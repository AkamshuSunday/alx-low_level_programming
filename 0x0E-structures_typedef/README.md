Create a C Project with Required Files:

Set up a C project with the necessary files (e.g., .c files, header files, README.md).
Ensure your code files are compatible with the specified editors (vi, vim, emacs).
Your code will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with specific options.
Follow the Betty Style Guide:

You can write test files (e.g., main.c) to verify the functionality of your functions, but they are not required to be pushed to your repository.
Create a README.md:

Write a README.md file at the root of your project folder. This file should provide an overview of your project, explain how to compile and run it, and include any other relevant information.
Push Your Code to a Repository:

Once you've completed the task, push your code to a repository.
