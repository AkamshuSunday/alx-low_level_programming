/* The following code uses an include guard to prevent multiple inclusions
   of this header file. 
   If SUM_H has not been defined yet, it gets defined here.
   The macro SUM is defined as a function-like macro. It takes two arguments,
   'x' and 'y', and returns the sum of these two values. The macro performs 
   addition using parentheses to ensure correct evaluation.
   This marks the end of the header
